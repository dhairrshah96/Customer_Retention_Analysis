## 1. Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze customer retention in an online retail dataset
and provide insights into repeat purchase behavior, churn risk, and loyalty segmentation.

---

## 2. Approach
- *Data Cleaning & Preparation:* Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized columns.  
- *Exploratory KPIs:* Sales by country, loyalty split, RFM analysis.  
- *Advanced Analysis:* Cohort retention heatmap, average retention by month.  
- *Power BI:* Dashboard pack prepared with CSV + images.  
- *JIRA Integration:* Sample sprint board for issue tracking and tasks.

## 3. Key Insights
- 72% of customers are repeat buyers, but ~28% purchase only once.  
- Customer retention drops from 100% in month 0 to ~15% by month 12.  
- United Kingdom dominates sales (~17M), followed by EIRE and Netherlands.  
- Highest monetary value comes from frequent and recent buyers (RFM 6+ / 0-30 days).  

---

## 4. Recommendations
- Launch *loyalty program* targeting one-time buyers with personalized offers.  
- Improve *early retention funnel* (first 3 months are critical).  
- Use *email campaigns* in smaller regions (EIRE, Netherlands) to grow base.  
- Create *JIRA epics* for implementing retention experiments.
